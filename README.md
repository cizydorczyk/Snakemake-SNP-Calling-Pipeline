# Snakemake-SNP-Calling-Pipeline
A Snakemake version of the i18 SNP calling pipeline.

# Description:
The pipeline runs snippy (and associated snippy-core/snippy-clean), removes reference/outgroups as required, iqtree, cfml, maskrc-svg, and snp-dists.

Note that snp-dists produces a SNP matrix but not p-distances. Use MegaX for that (or perhaps a future update if I find a tool for it).
